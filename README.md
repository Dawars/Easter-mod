You can do it by finding bugs or fixing them!
*Finding a bug:

### Write it down here: https://github.com/Dawars/Easter-mod/issues

* Fix a bug:
1. Fork this Repo
2. Make changes (bugfix)

### The Jenkins system is on the way!
It'll compile the code every time someone make changes in the code.
It makes easier to find bugs and to test the new features!
